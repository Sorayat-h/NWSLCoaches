Summary: This project aims to identify potential relationships between coach changes (hiring and firing) and subsequent NWSL team performance.

Business Problem: High coach turnover is a prevalent issue in the NWSL, potentially impacting team stability and hindering long-term development. Understanding how coaching changes influence performance can inform front-office decisions regarding coach selection and retention.

Hypothesis: Frequent coach changes lead to decreased performance in the following season, due to factors like disruption of playing style and reduced player-coach continuity.
